The dataset includes 267 images.
Icons are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 1280x1280 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
